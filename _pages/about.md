I am a Courant instructor at [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/), New York University, and an incoming tenure-track assistant professor at  [Industrial Engineering & Management Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/), Northwestern University. I received my Ph.D. degree in applied math from Stanford University in 2023 and my Bachelor’s degree in applied math from Peking University in 2019.

> **Advertisement** I am happy to host (remote) undergraduate/graduate visitors and looking for Ph.D. Students. Prospective Students see [here](https://2prime.github.io/students/). You can also find information about my research [here](https://2prime.github.io/research/) 

**To anyone:** I would appreciate [(anonymous) feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCWSzTQGMVKhxDVSiCopYD740Txm-cMoxIh-dg08FcRKT-8Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) about anything!

The long-term goal of my research is to develop a hybrid scientific research discipline that combines <mark color='orange'>domain knowledge</mark> (differential equation, stochastic process, control,...), <mark color='orange'>machine learning</mark> and <mark color='orange'>(randomized) experiments</mark>. To this end, I'm working on an interdisciplinary research approach across probability and statistics, machine learning, numerical algorithms, control theory, signal processing/inverse problem, and operations research. 

Here's my [<mark color='orange'>research statement</mark>](https://2prime.github.io/files/rs.pdf) and my latest [CV](https://www.overleaf.com/read/crybjbqmgxth).

**Fine-grained research interest:** Scientific Machine Learning (AI4Science), Stochastic Simulation, Machine Learning Theory (RKHS, Empirical Process, Deep Learning), Inverse Problem, Robust Machine Learning
