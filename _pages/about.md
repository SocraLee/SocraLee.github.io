I am a PhD student from University of Washington, advised by [Prof. Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/) . Previously, I received my M.Eng. degree at College of Engineering, UC Berkeley and my B.S. degree in Data Science at Peking University in 2022. I was also the second place(2/983000) of the Henan College Entrance Exam in 2018.

My research focuses on facilitating science discovery with deep learning techniques.

Here's my latest [CV](/assets/YongkangCV_2024Nov12th.pdf).

# Miscellaneous

In my spare time, I love playing competitive video games and enjoy using my strategy as well as talents to defeat my opponents in the ladder. I am a GrandMaster/Master player for multiple video games. Below is a glimpse of my gaming expertise:

- GrandMaster, No.50 on the CN server, [Heroes of the Storm](https://heroesofthestorm.blizzard.com/). I have a win rate of 70% in GM rank during my peak season.
- GrandMaster, Top 0.5% on the CN server, [Naraka Bladepoint](https://www.yjwujian.cn/).
- Master, Top 3% on the NA server, [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/).
- Master, [Teamfight Tactics Mobile(China)](https://teamfighttactics.leagueoflegends.com/). 
- Top 20%, [Chess](https://chess.com/). I started to learn Chess months ago and am quickly climbing the Elo ranks. The master title in Chess is highly distinguishable and will make a fine addition to my collection
