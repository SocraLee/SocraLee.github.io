I am a master student from [College of Engineering](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/), University of California Berkeley. I received my B.S. degree in Data Science (CS+Math) at Peking University in 2022.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ming Zhang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/dlib/mzhang/) of DLib from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University, and [Prof. Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/) from [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), University of Washington.

My research interest lies in natural language processing and large language models.

Here's my latest [CV](https://www.overleaf.com/read/crybjbqmgxth).
