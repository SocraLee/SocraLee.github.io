I am a master student from [College of Engineering](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/), University of California Berkeley. I received my B.S. degree in Data Science (CS+Math) at Peking University in 2022.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ming Zhang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/dlib/mzhang/) of DLib from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University, and [Prof. Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/) from [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), University of Washington. My capstone research project at Berkeley is advised by [Prof. Fleming Lee](https://funginstitute.berkeley.edu/people/lee-fleming/).

My research interest lies in applying large language models to biomedical problems.

Here's my latest [CV](https://www.overleaf.com/read/crybjbqmgxth).

## Using Large Language Model to Solve Biomedical Problems

LLM's common sense and code-greneating ability is not sufficient to directly solve biomedical problem. However, its ability is enough for determining what APIs it need and accurately using API calls.

By building a dataset of (Intruction, Code) pairs, and finetuning LLAMA based on it, we build a LLM-based assistant that can
