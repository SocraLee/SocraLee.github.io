I am a PhD student from University of Washington, advised by [Prof. Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/). Previously, I received my M.Eng. degree from UC Berkeley in 2024 and my B.S. degree from Peking University in 2022. I was also the second place(2/983000) of the Henan College Entrance Exam in 2018.

My research focuses on facilitating science discovery with deep learning techniques.

Here's my latest [CV](/assets/YongkangCV_2024Nov12th.pdf).
