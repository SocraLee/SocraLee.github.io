I am a master student from [College of Engineering](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/), University of California Berkeley. I received my Bachelor’s degree in data science (CS+Math) from Yuanpei College at Peking University in 2022.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. XXX](https://www.XXX.com/) of XXX Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University. I was advised by [Prof. XX](https://XXX.pku.edu.cn/) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.

**To anyone:** I would appreciate [(anonymous) feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCWSzTQGMVKhxDVSiCopYD740Txm-cMoxIh-dg08FcRKT-8Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) about anything!

Here's my [<mark color='orange'>research statement</mark>](https://2prime.github.io/files/rs.pdf) and my latest [CV](https://www.overleaf.com/read/crybjbqmgxth).

**Fine-grained research interest:** Scientific Machine Learning (AI4Science), Stochastic Simulation, Machine Learning Theory (RKHS, Empirical Process, Deep Learning), Inverse Problem, Robust Machine Learning
