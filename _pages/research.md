## ChemDiffuse: 3D Super-resolution chemical imaging via Diffusion-based Generative Model
Oct 2024 – Now 
- Developed ChemDiffuse for 3D super-resolution chemical imaging, targeting 40x resolution enhancement (4x in x-y plane, 10x in z-axis) and 160x lab sampling speed.
- Currently refining 3D diffusion implementation with promising initial results.


## Multi-agent System for Single Cell Analysis
May 2024 – Aug 2024
- Streamlined programming into three steps: requirement parsing, API assignment, and parameter selection/programming, each handled by an LLM group.
- Evaluated the performance of multi-agent systems compared to single language models, demonstrating significant improvements.
- Halted development after identifying a recent published system with broader library coverage and versatility.



## GNN-based Cross-domain Recommender System
Feb 2021 - Aug 2021
- Developed cross-domain recommender system to address cold start issues.
- Utilized attention-based graph neural networks, achieved significant improvement and published a paper.
