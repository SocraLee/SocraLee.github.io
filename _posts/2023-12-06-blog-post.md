Using LLM to choose and use biomedical apis.
### Brief Summary
This paper provide a pipeline for choosing and using biomedical functions/apis. The pipeline combines 
* a BERT-based API retriever. It will take a task instruction and return a short list of API candidates.
* a GPT-4-based API predictor. It will (with in-context learning) choose the most relevant API.
* a GPT-4-based generation pipeline of api calling that takes several steps to give the final script and show the result.

## Limitation
The backend of API calling (and prediction) is completely gpt4-based, which leads to unavoidable hallucination and limits the performance this work can possibly attain.

One possible direction is to finetune the backend of the API calling.
